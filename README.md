Works offline: without `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, the interview runs a scripted 3-question flow and
explanations use a deterministic template. With the key set, pydantic-ai agents are used
(`TRIPAI_MODEL`, default `anthropic:claude-sonnet-5-5`; `TRIPAI_LLM=0` forces them off).

| Endpoint | What |
|---|---|
| `POST /interview` `{messages, user_id}` | `{reply, profile?}`; the profile arrives when the interview is done |
| `GET /windows?from&to&min_days` | free windows from the calendar provider (fixture: 9-17 office job, PL holidays off) |
| `POST /windows` `{from, to, busy[], min_days}` | free windows from explicit busy intervals |
| `GET /windows/long-weekends?from&to&max_leave` | długi weekend radar: "Take 1 day off (Fri 28 May) -> 4 days" |
| `POST /recommendations` `{profile, windows?, weights?, limit, explain_top, today?}` | ranked `RankedRecommendation[]` |
| `POST /feedback` `{trip_id, answers, user_id, profile?, weights?}` | updated profile + weights + a `diff` saying what changed and why |
| `GET /health`, `GET /cities` | status / candidate cities |

- `tripai.scoring.rank()` is deterministic. Price (vs budget and vs the seasonal median), weather fit vs
  `preferred_temp_c`, crowds (lower is better) and taste fit (interests vs city tags) are combined
  with normalised weights. Each card carries counterfactuals (vs the same trip in peak season, the
  next-best window, the runner-up), a "what would flip it" hint and an `inputs_hash`: sha256 of the
  canonical inputs plus the scoring version.
- The explain agent may only use numbers that appear in the evidence. An output validator rejects any
  other number (`ModelRetry`), and after the retries run out it falls back to the template.
- Connector seam: `tripai.scoring.provider.TripDataProvider` / `CalendarProvider` (Protocols).
  `FixtureProvider` serves 10 cities from KRK; its evidence is labelled `fixture:*`. Pass a live
  provider with `create_app(provider=...)`.
- Holidays come from `data/holidays_pl.json` / `data/holidays.json` (Nager.Date format) when present,
  otherwise from the built-in PL table (computed from Easter, incl. Wigilia).
- `supabase/migrations/0001_init.sql`: profiles, recommendations, trips, feedback, api_cache. Not wired
  yet; the API uses an in-memory `Store`.
